# Mathematics-problems-and--Solutioins

This repository keeps track of the solution implementation of most problems mathematical problems 
using python(numpy and scipy).

[1. FIBONACCI NUMBERS](https://github.com/IshayaJAyock/Mathematics-problems-and--Solutioins/blob/master/FIBONACCI%20NUMBERS.ipynb):- The Fibonacci Number/Sequence is the sequence of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,13,21,34,...The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
which is a well known problem in mathematics.
